# History-of-Empires-and-The-World-RUSSIA
Android app, with text in romanian, that I made in the 11th grade.
It was supposed to be a series of all empires and how their territory evolved in time.
Made with Java, XML and graddle.

It showcases a map of the world, along with a time axis that lets the map evolve in time.
There's interactive lessons and quizzes for the user.

Had to upload it compressed in several winRAR archives because Android Studio doesn't support Java-based applications anymore.
